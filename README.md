# detect-node-support

List the Node.js versions supported by the package/repository

## Setup

No setup is required, however if you do not have a `GH_TOKEN` environment limit, you will likely hit a request rate limit on Github API, which may result in very long wait times for retries.

## Usage (command line)

```
$ npx detect-node-support [options] <path>
```

Prints the supported Node.js versions for the package at the specified path. When the path is not a git repository - tries to read the git repository from `package.json` and tries to detect the versions listed in the repository as well.

When `path` is omitted, tries to detect the versions for `cwd`. 

```
$ npx detect-node-support [options] <package name>
```

Prints supported Node.js versions for the package from the registry.

```
$ npx detect-node-support [options] <repository git URL>
```

Prints supported Node.js versions for the package at the git URL.

### Options

* `--deep` - when used with --deps, include indirect dependencies
* `--deps` - include the support information of direct production dependencies
* `--dev` - when used with --deps, include dev dependencies

## Usage (library)

```
const result = await require('detect-node-support').detect({ path }, options);
```

`path` should be a folder in the local file system. When the path is not a git repository - tries to read the git repository from `package.json` and tries to detect the versions listed in the repository as well. 

```
const result = await require('detect-node-support').detect({ packageName }, options);
```

`packageName` is a string name for the package in the registry. 

```
const result = await require('detect-node-support').detect({ repository }, options);
```

`repository` is a URL for a git repository.

```
const result = await require('detect-node-support').detect(what, options);
```

`what` is a string containing either a package name, or a local path, or a reference to a git repository.

### Options

- `deep: false` - when `true` and used `deps: true`, include indirect dependencies
- `deps: false` - when `true`, include the support information of all dependencies.
- `dev: false` - when `true` and used with `deps: true`, include dev dependencies

### Result

- Throws if the `path` / `repository` does not have a `package.json`
- Throws if `packageName` does not exist in the registry
- Throws when unable to detect a git repository for the package

Otherwise returns an object with:

```javascript
const result = {

    // the `name` field of the `package.json`
    "name": "package-name",    
    
    // the `version` field of the `package.json` when used with `path` / `repository`,

        },

        "errors": {
            "dependency-C": {
                // the `message` will always be either a string or `null`
                "message": "Failed to download some information or something"
            }       
        }       
    }
